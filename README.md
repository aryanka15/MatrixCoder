# MatrixCoder
A fun project inspired by my Precalculus class to code a matrix encoder and decoder for messages using Java.

Once starting the program, you can choose to encode or decode. While encoding, the program will save a .dat file in the database directory and will allow you to load from that while decoding, for the key matrix and the values

Messages must be alphabetical, only letters and spaces. No numbers or special characters. 

Have fun!
